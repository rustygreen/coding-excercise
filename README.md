# Coding Exercise

This repository is used as a means to help evaluate potential new hires without causing excess effort for either party.

## High-Level Directions
1. Clone the repository.
2. Read all of the directions in this README.md file.
3. Go through each folder and read the specific directions that apply to the TypeScript files in that folder (each folder has it's own README.md file).
4. Refactor the code, based on good programming practices, add any notes you'd like to include within the respective file (ideally at the end of the file so they are not mixed in with the code).
5. Create a Pull Request

## Objective
The primary objective of this exercise is to go through each of the TypeScript files and imagine that you are refactoring code to adhere to CLEAN code principles and SOLID principles.

**NOTES:**
* any missing code (or code marked with `<NO CODE NEEDED>`) means that there is no additional code or context needed to complete the task.
* use correct variable declarations
* follow CLEAN code principles
* follow SOLID principles

## Submission
Create a Pull Request against the [source repository](https://github.com/rustygreen/coding-exercise) with your changes. Use good commit best practices.
